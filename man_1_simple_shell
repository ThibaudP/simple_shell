hsh - command interpreter (shell)
.SH SYNOPSIS

hsh [\fIargument ...\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Holberton  project. Coding the (almost) same shell as the original sh (BOURNE SHELL).
.SS Overview
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file (non-interactive mode) or the terminal (interactive mode), interprets them, and generally executes other commands.
.SS Aliases
An alias is a name and corresponding value set using the alias(1) builtin command. The shell checks the word to see if it matches an alias. If it does, it replaces it in the input stream with its value.
.SS Path Search
When locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a shell function by that name. Then it looks for a builtin command by that name.  If a builtin command is not found, one of two things happen:
.TP
1.
Command names containing a slash are simply executed without performing any searches.
.TP
2.
The shell searches each entry in PATH in turn for the command. The value of the PATH variable should be a series of entries separated by colons. Each entry consists of a directory name.
